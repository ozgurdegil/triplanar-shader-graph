# triplanar-shader-graph
This project is an example of a Triplanar shader that can be used in Unity. A Triplanar shader provides a three-dimensional image by combining textures applied to surfaces from different angles. This shader is used to enhance the lines, bumps, and details of a surface by applying different textures based on the surface's normal vectors.
